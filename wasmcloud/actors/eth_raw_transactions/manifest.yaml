# EVM Raw Transactions Service (wasmCloud 1.0 - Native Rust Service)
#
# This service has been migrated from wasmCloud actor to native Rust service
# for better performance and to eliminate dependency conflicts.
#
# Deployment:
#   Development: cargo run --package eth_raw_transactions --bin eth_raw_transactions
#   Production:  Deploy as native binary with Docker/Kubernetes
#
# Configuration:
#   NATS_URL: NATS server URL (default: nats://127.0.0.1:4222)
#   REDIS_URL: Redis server URL (default: redis://127.0.0.1:6379)
#
# Architecture:
#   - Subscribes to: newheads.*.*.evm (NATS)
#   - Publishes to: transactions.raw.evm (NATS)
#   - Configuration: nodes:{network}:{subnet}:{vm_type} (Redis)
#   - RPC calls: Direct HTTP to blockchain nodes
#
# Scaling:
#   - Run multiple instances for horizontal scaling
#   - Each instance processes different blockchain networks
#   - Load balancing handled by NATS consumer groups
#
# NOTE: This manifest is kept for reference only.
# The service no longer runs as a wasmCloud actor.
