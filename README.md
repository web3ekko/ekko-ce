## Quickstart

The easiest way to get started with Ekko is using Docker Compose:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ekkoblock/ekko-ce.git
cd ekko-ce

# Copy and configure environment variables
cp .env.template .env
# Make sure to review and update .env with your NATS_URL if not using the default,
# and any other necessary configurations (e.g., API keys for external services if you add them).

# Start the services
docker-compose up -d
```

Once the services are running, you can access the Ekko Dashboard at `http://localhost:3000`.

**Creating an Initial User:**

To log in to the dashboard, you'll need a user account. You can create one using the provided script which interacts with the NATS Key-Value store where user data is stored.

Make sure your NATS server (e.g., `nats` service in `docker-compose.yml`) is running before executing this script.

```bash
# Run the user creation script (executes inside the 'api' service container)
docker-compose exec api python scripts/create_ekko_user.py
```

The script will interactively prompt you to enter the user's email, password, full name, and role (e.g., `admin` or `user`).

Alternatively, you can provide the details as command-line arguments:
```bash
docker-compose exec api python scripts/create_ekko_user.py --email your_email@example.com --password 'your_secure_password' --full_name "Your Full Name" --role admin
```
*   Ensure your password is enclosed in single quotes if it contains special characters that might be interpreted by the shell.
*   The `--role` can be `user` or `admin` (or other roles if defined in your system).

After creating a user, you can log in via the dashboard using the credentials you provided.

## Architecture

Ekko is built with a modular architecture focusing on real-time processing and scalability:

- **Bento Service:** Processes blockchain transactions and manages alerts
- **Web Dashboard:** Provides the user interface and data visualization
- **Valkey:** Handles caching and real-time data streaming
- **NATS JetStream:** Handles distributed messaging and event streaming
- **DuckDB:** Manages structured data for wallets, alerts, and workflows
